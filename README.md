# Whiteboard - Devsnest Hackathon 2

Whiteboards are an ideal support tool for planning meetings and team discussions, allowing you to jot down ideas, erase less popular suggestions and finalise your plan. Take a photo of the board at the end of the meeting to keep a record of it or create a follow up memo.<br/>
A web application where the user can draw on screen using different colors and also can adjust the thickness of the pencil and eraser.
Undo functionality has also been added using stack data structure.
